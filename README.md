# SR-SportCalendar-Exercise
The goal of this exercise is to assess your understanding of basic frontend programming concepts, including building user interfaces, handling user interactions, and ensuring responsiveness across devices. You will create a sports event calendar that displays events, allows users to view event details, and lets users add new events during runtime.
